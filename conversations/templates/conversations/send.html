                Type your message, the subject, and who it is to in the text boxes below.
                You may be able to use HTML (it hasn't been tested yet), but keep in mind that not all email apps support it.
                For convenience, your email and name are filled in by default, but you can change them to anything you'd like.

                In the <code>To</code> field, you can either enter just the email or a name and the corresponding email.
                <pre>
Email only:         example@test.com
Email with name:    Example Test &lt;example@test.com&gt;
